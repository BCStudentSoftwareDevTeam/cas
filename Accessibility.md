Purpose

Anywhere from 15 to 20% percent of people are disabled. If a website is not accessible then there are 
literally millions of people that are unable to access your website. If you have a website you want to 
make sure that everyone can us it, because you are proud of it, you want to make sure that it works. 
It's also a legal issue. The college would be open to lawsuits if there's website in not accessible.
Website accessibility isn't that hard either, it just adds a couple of steps to your coding routine. 
 
Before you issue a pull request that touches the front end (HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS) in any way, 
you MUST go through accessibility testing. If you code fails at any time during the "Beginner" portion of 
the checklist you must fix it before you're pull request can be accepted. You're pull request will not be accepted if it fails at at
any point during the "Beginner" portion of the checklist. 

Background

A lot of you don't know how to do website accessibility testing. So below is a link of a video run through of a basic accessibility test.

One of the thing you will need to download is a screen reader. If you have a PC you will be using NVDA, 
if you have a MAC you can just built in voice over. NVDA is a good screen reader, and I've been told by blind friend that 
it's better than the paid one anyway. Anyway, below are links that should help you learn how to work the screen readers 
since there are shortcuts that you need to use, because you want to navigate the sight a way a blind person would.

Screen readers are more compatible with certain browsers. For NVDA you need to use Firefox for testing and for Voice Over you need to use safari. 

Browsers: 
Firefox 
Google Chrome
Internet Explorer/Edge 
Safari (Mac Only)

Browser Extension (Works for both Chrome and Firefox):
